# Proof of concept for Astro + TinaCMS

## Goal

1. Defined pages using Astro.
1. Create dynamic pages with TinaCMS for editors and add them to Astro.
1. Keep defined pages (src/pages) and dynamic pages (content) separate.
1. Being able to create dynamic pages at root-level (like https://example.com/privacy-policy). In combination with pre-defined pages this can be difficult in some frameworks.
